    "# How to Use Llama Stack TRL Remote Provider\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The TRL Remote Provider enables you to:\n",
    "- Upload preference datasets for remote training\n",
    "- Submit DPO training jobs to remote TRL service\n",
    "- Monitor remote training progress and retrieve artifacts\n",
    "- Manage distributed post-training workflows through a REST API\n",

    "3. You have the required dependencies installed\n",
    "4. The client is configured with the remote TRL provider\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
